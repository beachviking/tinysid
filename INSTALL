SIDPlayer Installation Instructions
===================================


BeOS
----

The easiest way is to download one of the precompiled BeOS binary archives
(x86 or PowerPC, depending on your CPU architecture). Simply unexpand the
archive to your hard drive.

SIDPlayer can also be used as an input plugin for CL-Amp by Claes Löfqvist
and SoundPlay by Marco Nelissen. To use it with CL-Amp, copy the "SIDPlayer"
application to your CL-Amp "Plugins" directory (you have to copy it, placing
a link won't work) and rename it to "in_SIDPlayer". To use it with SoundPlay,
simply copy or link the program to your SoundPlay "Plugins" directory (it's
not necessary to rename it).

If you downloaded the source, you can compile it using the following
command:

 $ make -f Makefile.BeOS


Unix
----

SIDPlayer requires the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library, available
from the official SDL site:

  http://www.libsdl.org/

If you didn't install SDL from source, you have to install the "SDL-devel"
package to compile SIDPlayer.

As with any autoconfiguring GNU software, installation is as easy as this:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 [become root]
 # make install

For a complete list of options that the "configure" script takes, type

 $ ./configure --help

The most important option is

 --prefix=PREFIX

which you can use to specify a different installation directory (the default
is /usr/local). The "sidplayer" executable will be installed in PREFIX/bin.
